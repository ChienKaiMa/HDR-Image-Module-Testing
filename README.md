# HDR Image Module Testing ðŸ“·
Testing modules and repositories for HDR imaging.<br>

## Final words before the last update (probably)
This repository was intended to find a usable Python module for our DCLab final project.  We planned to generate HDR images (grayscale) from Python to validate the results generated by FPGA.  Therefore, after we made sure that the first repo on the list worked, we stopped testing other modules.<br>

I list below the repos that we didn't test, just for reference.  It's interesting to find that some of them are still updating their code.

By the way, the source code of the first repo was too slow (had redundancy and processed RGB channels), so my classmate rewrote a significantly faster version for grayscale HDR image generation.<br>
